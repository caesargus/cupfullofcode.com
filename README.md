# Cup Full of Code

This is the personal website and blog of Matthew M. Keeler.  It is built on top
of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and provides me a little corner of the web to
chat about whatever.

## Setup

In order to build this site, you must do the following:

    git clone git://github.com/keelerm84/cupfullofcode.com
    cd cupfullofcode.com
    gem install jekyll bundler
    bundle install
    jekyll build

If you plan on making changes, you can optionally do:

    jekyll serve --watch
